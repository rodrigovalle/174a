Here is a lesson that's necessary to solve one part of the exam!

These are opposite qeustions:
 1. How do I convert basis A to basis B?
 2. 

Final
 - What were the formulas used during project 3?
   know phong formula, reflection formula: 2*(V dot N) - V

 - What are the dependent variables when trying to find where a line's vanishing
   point is?
   Line equation expressed s + tc
   will vanishing point depend on both s & c? or just one?
   will s change vanishing point? nope (all lines converge to vanishing point if
   they're parallel to each other)

 - What sequence of matrices reflects point P around an arbitrary plane, given
   the plane's equation?
   plane given in implicit form, linear combination of x y & z
   be able to find normal from plane equation
   set up the situation so that the plane is really easy (rotate twice), then scale
   by 1, 1, -1 to flip along the z axis
   know 3d rotation matrix?

 - What sequence of matrices change a point's basis from any pair of arrows
   A to a pair B? (Be careful: try a simple case first where A is just a single
   translation away from being B)
   inverse model transform matrix

   p1 = p in original (identity) basis
   p = A^-1 * p1

   point is expressed in A

   point in B = ?

   B^-1 * A * p

   ==> B^-1 * A * (A^-1 * p1)
   ==> B^-1 * p1

   also: (ABC)^-1 = C^-1 * B^-1 * A^-1

   A = MB
   M turns B into A
   M expresses a point in A in B instead

 - What's one sequence of matrices that can be used to connect two squares by
   a corner?

 - Implicit, Explicit, and Parametric -- How do you convert between any pair of
   these equation types?
